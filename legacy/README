RTXI v1.3 Installing Modules

In the terminal (In Ubuntu, Applications > Accessories > Terminal) :

$ cd MODULE_DIR
$ sudo make install

RTXI v1.3 requires a call to createGUI(var, num_vars) in the module constructor. If you are using an older version of RTXI, you should comment out or delete this line.

This module contains an option to sync the experiment trials to the Data Recorder. You will need to include
the header file to the Data Recorder source code in the HFAC header file at line 21.
